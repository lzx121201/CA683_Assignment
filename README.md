## Abstract
In  the  past  few  years,  there  has  been  an  enormousincrease  in  the  textual  data  from  social  media  (Twitter,  Google,Quora, Reddit) over the internet. Sometimes the text is opinion-ated,  and  authors  have  different  emotions  behind  that,  whichrefers  to  sarcasm  and  identifies  these  comments  as  Sarcasmdetection.  Sarcasm  is  often  used  to  mock  people,  generally  seenas  using  positive  words  to  express  negative  emotions.  We  aimto  analyse  the  sarcastic  and  non-sarcastic  comments  on  theReddit  website.  In  this  project,  we  have  applied  a  wide  rangeof classification algorithms on different feature sets to check theaccuracy  of  every  situation  to  classify  whether  the  statement  issarcasm or not. Our experimental results show a Gated RecurrentUnit  model  gives  an  accuracy  of  73.73%,  which  is  the  highestamong all attempted approaches, while high loss indicates roomfor  improvement.
